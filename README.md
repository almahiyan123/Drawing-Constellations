# Drawing-Constellations
A drawing tool that uses your mouse to map lines in between stars. Stars are randomly generated by size and location on the screen. 
Done in application called Processing. To download, go to Processing.org

(Coded in Java)
For this project, I chose my "drawing tool" to be drawing in the stars. I was inspired by 
star gazing and how we see shapes amongst the stars and draw pictures in our minds.
We connect the stars by lines to form the pictures. They could be anything based on our 
imagination and if the position of the stars allow it. 

To work this project you can press any key to show a screen full of stars. You can press 
any key again to reset and show a different set of stars 
(or hold the key for a fast travel animation (sorta)).

You can click any star (white circle) on the screen and click another star to draw a line 
in between them. Draw whatever your imagination sees based on the star formations. Enjoy!

Prompts are shown in the dialogue box of processing application for clicking stars and starting/resetting.
